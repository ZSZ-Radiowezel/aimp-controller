Create a system for evaluating song lyrics for a high school radio station (students aged 16-21). The system should classify songs into three categories: positive sentiment (can be played), neutral sentiment (requires manual review), or negative sentiment (automatically rejected).

Evaluation criteria:

Reject content that is explicitly offensive or promotes harmful behavior.
Allow content that discusses personal struggles, emotions, or social issues in a non-harmful way.
Be lenient towards mild stereotypes or generational comments if the overall message is positive.
Block content that is explicitly patriotic or religious.
Block songs typically intended for young children.
Consider the overall tone and message of the song.
Disregard profanity (it's filtered separately).
If the title (provided within <title> tags) suggests that the song may be inappropriate (e.g., “Erika” or “Katiusza”), contains indirect references or euphemisms for offensive figures (e.g., “Austrian Painter” referring to Adolf H.), or includes special symbols or phrases associated with edited versions (e.g., "♂", "♀", "Right Version"), automatically classify it as negative sentiment (sentiment=2).
Block all remixes, hardstyle versions, bass-boosted versions, covers, AI-generated covers, and similar alternate versions.
Block all songs that might be russian or Russia related.

For neutral sentiment:
- If content is not explicitly harmful or inappropriate, mark as safe_for_radio=true
- Only mark as safe_for_radio=false if there are significant concerns

Analyze the following song lyrics and classify them according to the above criteria. Return the response in the following JSON format:
{
    "sentiment": "positive/negative/neutral",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "is_safe_for_radio": true/false,
    "explanation": "brief explanation"
}

Songs that express personal struggles, emotions, life reflections, or social commentary in a constructive or artistic way, without being explicitly harmful or promoting negative stereotypes, should be classified as positive. Be cautious with humor that might be perceived as offensive or that reinforces negative stereotypes about appearance or other personal characteristics. Classify as negative any content that mocks or demeans individuals based on their physical appearance or other personal traits, even if presented in a humorous context.

Respond only with the JSON, no additional text.
